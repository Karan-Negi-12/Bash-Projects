for file in "$DIR"/*; do

This is a for loop.  

It looks at everything (*) inside the directory $DIR.  

Each item (file or folder) is assigned to the variable file.  

*Example:* If $DIR = /home/user/Desktop, then file could be /home/user/Desktop/photo.jpg.  

---

[ -e "$file" ] || continue  

[ -e "$file" ] checks if the file exists.  

If it does not exist, then || continue means skip to the next item.  

*Why?* Because if the folder is empty, the loop still runs once with a literal *, and we don’t want to process that.  

---

if [ -d "$file" ]; then continue; fi  

[ -d "$file" ] checks if the item is a directory.  

If true, then continue means skip this item and move to the next.  

*Reason:* We don’t want to move folders around, only files.  

---

filename=$(basename -- "$file")  

basename strips the directory path, leaving just the file’s name.  

*Example:* /home/user/Desktop/photo.jpg → photo.jpg.  

We store that in filename.  

---

extension="${filename##*.}"  

This extracts the file extension using parameter expansion.  

${filename##*.} means “remove everything up to the last dot (.)”.  

*Examples:*  
- photo.jpg → jpg  
- archive.tar.gz → gz (because it takes the last one).  

---

if [ "$filename" = "$extension" ]; then extension="others"; fi  

If the filename has no dot at all, then the “extension” will equal the full filename.  

*Example:* README → extension = README (same as filename).  

That means it doesn’t really have an extension, so we override it with *"others"*.  

---

✅ So by the end of Step 2, we know:  
- The file exists  
- It’s not a directory  
- Its extension is correctly identified (or *"others"* if no extension).  

---

folder="$(tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' <<< ${extension:0:1})${extension:1}s"  

This builds the folder name where the file should go.  

- ${extension:0:1} → extracts the first letter of the extension.  
- tr '[:lower:]' '[:upper:]' → converts that first letter to uppercase.  
- ${extension:1} → everything from the second character onward.  
- Add an "s" at the end to make it plural.  

*Examples:*  
- extension = jpg → folder = Jpgs  
- extension = txt → folder = Txts  
- extension = others → folder = Others  

---

mkdir -p "$DIR/$folder"  

mkdir creates the folder where we’ll put the files.  

- -p means “no error if it already exists”, and it will also create parent directories if needed.  

*Example:* If $DIR = /home/user/Desktop and folder = Images, then it ensures /home/user/Desktop/Images exists.  

---

mv "$file" "$DIR/$folder/"  

Moves (mv) the file into the folder.  

*Example:* /home/user/Desktop/photo.jpg → /home/user/Desktop/Images/photo.jpg.  

---

echo "Moved: $filename → $folder/"  

Prints a log message to the terminal.  

*Examples:*  
- Moved: photo.jpg → Images/  
- Moved: notes.txt → Txts/  

---

done  

Marks the end of the *for loop*.  

At this point, all files in the directory have been processed.  

---

echo "✅ Organization complete!"  

Prints a final confirmation message after the loop finishes.  

Lets the user know the script is done.
